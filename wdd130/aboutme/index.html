    <h2>Palesa Nzimande</h2>
    <p>My name is Palesa. I am majoring in Applied Technology.
        Some of the things I enjoy doing is reading, doing cross word puzzles,
        I also enjoy going out with friends. Ive been a member of the church all my life.
        It is one of the things I'm most gratefull for. I do not who I would be without the 
        gospel of Jesus Christ. I look forward to gaining knowledge and improving myself as a individual.
